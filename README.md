# Beryllium

### Beryllium Summary

Beryllium contains shared code that is used throughout all Beryllium apps, including
[Beryllium-Maven](https://github.com/lasp/beryllium-maven.git)
and [Beryllium-MMS](https://github.com/lasp/beryllium-mms.git).

### Related Projects

* [beryllium-maven](https://github.com/lasp/beryllium-maven.git):
    Beryllium application for the Maven mission.
* [beryllium-mms](https://github.com/lasp/beryllium-mms.git):
    Beryllium application for the MMS mission.

### Architecture

Beryllium itself provides a handful of Angular components and services for Beryllium apps
to use. The most thorough documentation of what's available can be found in the code comments,
but a few notable examples are listed here:

* The `<cesium></cesium>` component: Renders a CesiumJs Viewer, which does all of the 3D
    work for us. Must be configured by adding custom directives/components in between the
    `<cesium>` tags. Those directives will probably want to require `"^^cesium"` to access
    the `<cesium>` Controller's API (see:
    [require for directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive#creating-directives-that-communicate),
    [require for components](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component#intercomponent-communication))
* The `AbstractClass` service: provides a global "superclass" to help with prototypal
    inheritance. Used by `AbstractDataProvider`, `AbstractDataTransformer`, and others.
* `DataProviders`s and `DataTransformer`s: Subclasses of `AbstractDataProvider` and
    `AbstractDataTransformer`. Both classes implement the same API so that they can be
    easily interchanged with each other. DataProviders are intended to provide raw data
    to the app (usually via ajax), and DataTransformers are intended to transform the
    raw data into a more usable form (usually
    [Cesium.Property](https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Documentation/Property.html)
    instances). DataTransformers can be linked directly to
    DataProviders, or to other DataTransformers to allow complex processing to be broken up
    into steps. Both DataProviders and DataTransformers can have any number of "children"
    ("children" can mean either attached DataTransformers, or visual components that
    display the data, or both. The attachment method is the same in either case).
* `Requirements` and `RequirementsManager` classes: Provide a standard method for
    DataProviders and DataTransformers to request requirements (parameters) from the
    instances that depend on them.
* The `berylliumColors` service: Provides basic utilities for working with color gradients
    (e.g. color interpolation). Provides access to colormaps ripped from
    [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html).
* The `Latis` class: Provides utility methods for making ajax requests to a latis instance.

### Build System

We use a standard [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) build system for this project.

##### Task Cheatsheet

```
npm run build // removes the dist folder and any/all temporary folders and then rebuilds the project to the dist folder
npm run watch // watches the project and rebuilds when changes are detected
```

### Running Beryllium

Since Beryllium is just a shared code repository, new changes will need to be tested through
Beryllium-Maven or Beryllium-MMS. To test the local copy of beryllium, you can use the
[bower link](https://bower.io/docs/api/#link) command.

1. In one terminal (you'll need 2 eventually):
    1. `cd beryllium`
    1. `npm install`
    1. `bower link`
        * This installs `beryllium` as a link-able dependency globally on the current machine. You only need to run this once per machine
    1. `npm run watch`
        * Just leave this task running until we're done. You can skip this step and manually `npm run build` every time you make changes if you would like.
1. In another terminal
    1. `cd beryllium-maven` or `cd beryllium-mms`
    1. `npm install`
    1. `bower link beryllium`
        * This replaces `bower_components/beryllium` with a symlink to the `beryllium` repo you installed in the other terminal. Be sure not to commit this symlink.
    1. `npm start`
1. Make some easily-visible changes to the `beryllium` project (e.g. change some text in the dateRangePicker component)
    1. Notice that the `npm run watch` task in the first tab automatically rebuilds the `beryllium` project (it happens fast, don't blink!)
    1. Notice that, once `beryllium` has been rebuilt, the `npm start` task in the second tab automatically rebuilds the `beryllium-mms` project and reloads your browser tab
    1. Notice that your change is now visible in the browser
1. Kill the running `npm start` task (`ctrl+c`)
1. `bower uninstall beryllium` to remove the symlink

### Run Beryllium without a local copy
1. `cd beryllium-maven` or `cd beryllium-mms`
1. `npm install`
    1. This installs all the node modules required for this project.
1. `bower install`
    1. This installs the copy of beryllium that is on the GitHub master branch.
1. `npm start`

### Deploying Beryllium

Since Beryllium-Maven and Beryllium-MMS are connected to the master branch of the Beryllium repository,
simply push your most recent Beryllium code to the master branch. After running `bower update beryllium` in the Beryllium-Maven
or Beryllium-MMS project command line, the beryllium bower component will include your most recent changes.
